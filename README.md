## What is this?

This repo contains solutions for Advent of code 2023. I decided to write my solutions in Rust, because I want to learn rust and become better at it, so what's a better way to do that than by writing code?

### How to run?
To run the project, add the input files for each day in the inputs directory. The files should be named like "day5.txt"

To run all days, use:
```
cargo run
```

To run a specific day, use:
```
cargo run day_number
```
